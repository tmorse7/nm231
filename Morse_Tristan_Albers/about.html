                With the three main pages that I did, I chose to play around with the Boundaries exercise, the Transparency exercise, and the Color Interaction exercise. With those, I found it to be pretty straight forward, as I modeled them off of the exercises from the reading. The other three, however, I wanted to make a theme that connected them together. Music is really important to me and I thought it could be applicable with these exercises. For the first webpage, I chose to go with a couple of records that showed the “Color Interaction” exercise in a different way. This is shown with different colors for the records with the same color in the center. Although it’s the same color in the center, because of the different colored records, they appear as two different colors. For the second one, I chose to show the “Transparency” exercise with what looks like an audio level panel. I showed this by having a "glare" on the screen, as if the sun were shining on it. It showed how color can change when sunlight is applied to it if the color is on a screen. I thought this was a neat idea, since I have to deal with it all the time with my computer monitors when the sunlight hits it. As for the last one, I chose to have varying shades of the color purple, since I love purple so much and chose to show them as CD cases. The CD's in the cases are the greyscale versions of each case color, demonstrating the "Hue as Value" exercise. The CD's were used to keep the theme of music, and are kind of an homage to my childhood when I would listen to CD’s all the time and would play them with a portable CD player.
