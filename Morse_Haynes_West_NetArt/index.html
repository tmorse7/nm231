            <p>[-bio : --Cory Arcangel is an independent artist stationed out of Stavanger, Norway and born in Brooklyn, New York. In the year 2000, he graduated from Oberlin Conservatory of Music with a degree in music technology. He creates multi media artwork, music artwork, and web artwork. In 2006, he received the Creative Capital Emerging Fields Award. Some of his artwork includes sculptures created out of pool noodles and game cartridges, which are physically reprogramed. Some of his most famous reprogramming projects include Super Mario Clouds, I Shot Andy Warhol, and Totally Fucked.]</p>

                <p>[-q : --In what way were they using the web as a medium (considering the time/era they were working)?]</p>
                <p>[-a : --Thinking respectively to the time this project was created (2004), there was no online pizza ordering/delivery services. If you wanted a pizza delivered to your doorstep, you had to pick up the phone and call. Cory Arcangel created a code to follow in order to create your customized pizza and have it delivered through the command line.]</p>

            <div class="qa">
                <p>[-q : --In what way can this be considered art?]</p>
                <p>[-a : --After viewing Cory Arcangel’s pizza party, we determined that this piece is more innovation than art. Although it does clearly demonstrate the unique, and facetious art of avoiding phone calls, and ordering pizza for delivery.]</p>

            <div class="qa">
                <p>[-q : --What is technically interesting about this project?]</p>
                <p>[-a : --The technical aspect of this project is impressive for its time, as it uses Perl to connect online with an account with Dominos, asks what pizza you want, and asks for you to confirm your order. All of this is done through command line using Perl and an executable file called “./pizza_party”. On the user’s end, though, they have to import certain Perl packages or “modules,” which, if the user does not know how to do, is unable to use this tool. This may knock out a lot of people, and only allows those with more programming background to be able to use this to order pizza. Besides the main part though, there are several other things users would have to change like the location of the man page and the information stored in the “.pizza_partyrc” file. It’s interesting to see how many extra steps there are for the user to take. It seems a lot more complex than it needs to be in this current time, as a lot more of these steps would be more automated through the code itself.]</p>

                <p>[-q : --What was the artist trying to express? How are the techniques used helping/hindering this expression?]</p>
                <p>[-a : --Although it seems like more of a practical tool than an art piece, there is a concept that Arcangel may be trying to convey. By making a program like this, it could show the distancing between people through the use of technology. This is shown by making a process that usually requires one to call a person to get a pizza more digitized, thus cutting out that main part of human interaction. By using the terminal to do this, it definitely emphasizes that disconnect from human interaction.</p>
