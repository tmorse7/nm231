                As I was thinking about an idea for this assignment, I was trying to come up with something that appealed to my interests in some way. As of recently, I had gotten an Oculus Rift VR headset and wanted to try it out on a game that was free, which so happened to be a game called VR Chat. I was thinking about all of the crazy characters I saw and the stories that I was a part of in this game, as there are quite a lot. With this, I got my idea to try to make a “create your own adventure” style website to showcase some of these stories. However, most of the experiences I had on VR Chat can’t fully be described without going on for some time about them. So, due to the limited amount of time I had to work on this and the limited amount of pages to work with, I decided to shorten them down a bit. I also thought it would be good to do so then the player going through this website could get exposure to several stories in one place. With that, I made a nice blend of several stories into one to get the player to really see what kind of a strange and interesting game VR Chat can be. It lets the person going through the website choose from a good variety of paths to explore and the best part is, you can keep replaying it as much as you want and choose other options if you reach a dead end. It’s almost like a metaphor for VR Chat, because the fun never seems to end. Buckle up and enjoy! Check out some images below!
