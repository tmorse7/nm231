                I told the cat that I don't like bobbleheads. There's something about their strange proportions that seem really weird to me. The cat takes a step back. He says in a deep voice, "then perish." All of the sudden, he starts to do a Mongolian chant. I take a step back and noticed that the cat put a portal behind me. I was too late to realize it, as I had already fallen through it. Everything around me gets enveloped by starts and space as I got warped to another place. Within a few minutes, I appeared in a world with a long hallway and at the end of it, was Marge Simpson. I walked towards her and noticed that it's only her and I in this world. As I stood infront of her, I heard her loud voice ring throughout the hallway, "I'll krump with you, sweetie pie!" The sheer power of her voice knocked me down in pain. This is the end... isn't it...
