                I choose to go over to the bar to go see what Johnny Bravo and Yuri were talking about. As I walk up to them, Johnny Bravo looked down at me and said "Hi! Do you want to join my minecraft server?!?". He sounded like a 9 year old boy. What is he doing in a bar? Yuri looks towards me but doesn't speak. She raises her right hand and motions for me to come closer. What should I do?
