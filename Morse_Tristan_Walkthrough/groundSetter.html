                I awaken with a start. I look around and see nothing but stars. There's a menu that popped up infront of me saying "Teleporting to The Pug." After a few moments, I appear in a bar with several patrons roaming about. Kermit the Frog is having a drink with Link from The Legend of Zelda at a table, Peter Griffin and a Canadian from South Park are serving drinks at the bar, and Johnny Bravo is sitting on a stool striking up a conversation with Yuri from Doki Doki Literature club. It's quite a spectacle to behold and wait... am I shorter than normal? How strange... What should I do?
