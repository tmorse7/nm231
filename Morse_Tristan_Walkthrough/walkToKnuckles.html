                I walk over to the Knuckles by the fire. He asked me "do you know the way?" I shrug, as I have no idea what he's talking about. After looking at me, he said "I will show you the way. Follow me." The Knuckles then walked over to a corner in the room and openned up a portal to... Uganda? What? Knuckles then said "follow me" and walked through the portal. This makes no sense, but okay. I'll go. I step into the portal and space wrapped around me with stars shinning as far as I could see. Within a minute or so, I find myself standing on a small island. I looked infont of me and saw a ravenous pack of mini Knuckles, all clicking their tongues in a circle. At the center of the circle was a little anime girl, but instead of having a cutsie face, she had the face of Knuckles... What... the hell?? I immediately found this to be annoying and felt the strong urge to punt each and every one of them, but alas, I was outnumbered. So instead, I jumped into the ocean and swam away as far as humanly possible...
