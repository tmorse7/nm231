                I try to engage myself in a convorsation with Kermit, but it seems like he's really focused on what he's talking about. A moment later, a Winnie the Pooh walked over to the table and started blaring the Soviet Union national anthem. It was incredibly loud, so I decide to venture to another part of the bar.
