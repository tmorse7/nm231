                I try to lift the weight on my head and everything around me disappeared. The bar, the bar patrons, the mirror I was standing in front of. All gone. I blink and realize that I'm in another room that seems all too familiar. Oh... It's my room in my appartment. I look at my hands and see that I'm holding Oculus Rift controllers and in my right hand, I have the weight I pulled off of my head. It was an Oculus Rift headset. Everything seemed all too real though, besides all of the fictional characters that were in the bar and my "different" appearance. It felt like I could reach out and touch them, like they were almost there... maybe I should take a break. How long was I playing for...? WHAT?!? Is it really 5:30 AM the next day?!?
