                After that whole escapade with Yuri, when I got some distance from her, I noticed a noise coming from upstairs. Curious, I walked up the stairs to see what was making the feint sounds I was hearing. As I got closer, it seemed that the noise got louder until I saw where it was coming from. There was a stage on the far end of a large room with a microphone on a mic stand. A cat that was standing upright was meowing into the microphone. What...?
