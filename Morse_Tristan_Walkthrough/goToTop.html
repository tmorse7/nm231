                I begin to walk up the stairs and start to hear another odd noise. I could faintly hear someone clicking their tongue above me. Curious, I keep walking up the stairs. Oof, how high up is the top floor? I've climbed so many stairs by now... After some time, I finally reached the top and glanced around the room. There's a fireplace on the left with several chairs and a sofa around it, there are a few tables on the right with some chairs around them, and there's an upper loft above them. Above the stairwell that I was coming out of had a sign with "The Roost" written on it in big, white letters. How interesting. As I was looking around, I heard the clicking noise again. I turn to my left, towards the fireplace, and saw a small Knuckles the Echidna from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. He's a bit smaller and strange-looking than what I remember. Hmm... what should I do?
