                After thinking it over, I decide to get closer to Yuri. Somethings off about her though... Her pupils were really small compared to how they usually are. How ominous... As I got closer, she starts patting my head and pulls out a knife with her other hand from behind her back. I freak out and rush away from her. She put her hand on her mouth and didn't pursue me. She just went back to what she was doing at the bar. They don't call her knife wife for nothing, I suppose. I think I may wanna go somewhere else...
