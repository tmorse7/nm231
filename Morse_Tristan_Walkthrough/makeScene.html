                I demand for some alcohol. I look to my left and see a couple of shot glasses full of some sort of alcohol. I quickly grabbed them and start pounding them down. Peter Griffin and the Canadian from South Park start freaking out and try to take the shot glasses away. I flail my arms so they can't get to them and they started to laugh while trying to tell me to stop. After catching his breath after laughing, Peter Griffin said "man, this kid is crazy. We need to kick them outta here." After he said that, I was immediately kicked out of the bar.
