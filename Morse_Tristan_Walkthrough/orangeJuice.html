                I ask for a glass of orange juice. "One orange juice comin' right up!" Peter Griffin exclaimed. He picked up a glass of orange juice... but it was floating in front of him? Does he have telepathy or something? Hmmm... He hands me the glass and I drink the juice, wondering how he did that. After having a nice, cold, refreshing glass of OJ that doesn't seem like it was actually real at all, I decide to look around some more in the bar.
