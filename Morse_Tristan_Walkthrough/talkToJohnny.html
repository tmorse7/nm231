                I decide to talk to Johnny Bravo. He keeps rambling about Minecraft and how many Robucks his parents give him for Roblox. I find this very obnoxious and walk away from him. He proceeds to follow me, so I run around the bar to try to get away from him. He finally gave up and returned back to his seat next to Yuri. Well that was annoying. I think I should probably avoid him from now on.
