                I walk over to the mirror and instead of seeing myself, I see a small anime girl with wolf ears and a tail. What...? That's not me. But when I moved my hands and moved my head, it's me doing the movements for the girl... This is really weird. Now that I think about it though, I feel a weird weight on my head and weights in my hands.
